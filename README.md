Messing around with Python &amp; Flask

# THIS IS STILL A W.I.P!!!

## About
This is intended to be simple blog software written in Python. Primarily used as a tool for me to learn more about the language. 

In the end I hope it will have the following features:
- Simple Login/Authentication system (That is hopefully somewhat secure!)
- Simple permission system (To limit what users can do)
- Nice editor for creating posts (with Markdown!)

#### Libraries
These are the tools I have used to create this. These people are smarter than me.

- [flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask) - Web framework
- [mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune) - Markdown parsing/rendering
- [pycrypto](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto) - Cryptography library
